I'm a Computer Science graduate from the UK currently struggling to get my foot in the field. This blog is dedicated to everything that goes I think about and spend my time on that I think would be worth sharing with whoever is willing to listen. Technology topics mainly include my personal projects and whatever I am tinkering with but also discussion around it's ramifications on social behaviour and healthy human-computer interaction. I also discuss language aquisition, linguistics and it's relevant tooling as well as various other topics.
